Hi, I'm Gracie and I'm autistic. This doesn't mean that I lack connection. This doesn't mean that I don't like being social. It just means that I think and act differently than what is expected. Easy things are hard for me and hard things are easy. I'm confused by rules that neuro-typical people know intuitively, and I don't know how to read a room or take a hint. When people expect one behavior and get another from me I get <a className="App-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lugR8NaPiM">inaccurately labeled.</a> For example, I get labeled as a bitch when I ask a question that seems rhetorical but is not (or when I tell someone they remind me of a poodle). I get called a liar when my body language doesn't match what I'm saying, and 'a lot' when I get talking about something and don't understand the boundaries around sharing - I'm a classic oversharer who doesn't know when someone isn't into the conversation. But if I'm being honest, 'a lot' is exactly what I am, because that's kind of how I view autism. It's a lot of stimulation, a lot of thinking, a lot of moving, a lot of emotion, a lot of deep understanding and empathy on a greater scale.
 
Because I'm a heavy <a className="App-link" href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/costs-camouflaging-autism/">masker</a> and actually spend a great deal of time and effort trying to understand how to recognize social rules and other people's experience, I'm the typical case of "but you don't seem autistic". Masking can be really exhausting and is something I don't need to do around other autistic people who take me at face value and don't have qualms about telling me to stop talking, or anything else really. 
 
With this in mind, I thought it would be helpful to write a little API for interacting with me in order to help you understand me better and to give myself a break from masking.
