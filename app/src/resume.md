Hi, I'm Gracie. I am a systems minded individual which fueled my fascination for the social sciences and eventually led me towards computer science and engineering. I espouse transparency and honesty in both my personal and professional life.

## Work Experience
#### Java Developer | Utah Interactive | 2018 - Present
I add features, fix bugs and unit test a variety of dot gov webapps. We use an MVC architecture using jsp pages to render the view, with newer apps using RESTful APIs and static content.  My typical workflow is estimating work in Jira tickets, local development, building in a testing enviroment, then requesting QA at which point my work is tested then deployed to a stage enviroment for customer testing. Once the customer has approved the work it is deployed to production.

Due to the nature of government contract work we ship code that often sits and ages, waiting until a customer requests a feature or change. This is one of the more challenging parts of my job due to the ever increasing surface of secuirty vulnerabilies and the our strict requirments on mitigation.


#### Technical Support | Utah Interactive | 2014 - 2016
As a tech support representitive, I answered phones, emails and online chats to triage issues with over 200 Utah.gov websites. This position gave me a strong familiaraity with our websites and end users which lent invaluable experience to my position as a web developer.  

## Unconventional Work Expereince
#### Stay at Home Parent | 2016 - 2018
As a stay at home parent I created a routine for two babies (16 months apart in age!) by drawing on my experience as a former Montessori teacher. I also organized an affordable monthly parent and baby meet up at the Tracy Aviary with other stay at home parents. 
As the stay at home parent I naturally took on more duties around the home. I created processes to acheive efficenity with household chores and to open better lines of communication between my spouse and I. My spouse and I have used a kanban board on our kitchen wall with a baglog of household chores needing to be done.
