## Work Experience
#### Java Developer | Utah Interactive | 2018 - Present
I add features, fix bugs and unit test a variety of dot gov webapps. We use an MVC architecture using jsp pages to render the view, with newer apps using RESTful APIs and static content.  My typical workflow is estimating work in Jira tickets, local development, building in a testing environment, then requesting QA at which point my work is tested then deployed to a stage environment for customer testing. Once the customer has approved the work it is deployed to production.

The nature of government contract work is to sometimes ship code that will sit and age, waiting until our clients request a change or feature. This ends up being one of the more challenging parts of my job as the surface of security vulnerabilities increases, and our strict requirements around mitigation.

#### Technical Support | Utah Interactive | 2014 - 2016
As a technical support representative, I answered phones, emails and online chats to triage issues with over 200 <a className="App-link" href="https://www.utah.gov">utah.gov</a> websites. This position gave me a strong familiarity with our websites and the end-user experience, two things I've found invaluable to my new role as a web developer.  

## Unconventional Work Experience
#### Stay at Home Parent | 2016 - 2018
As a stay at home parent I created a routine for two babies (16 months apart in age!), drawing on my experience as a former teacher at a <a className="App-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education">Montessori</a> school. I also organized an affordable monthly parent and baby meet up at the Tracy Aviary with other stay at home parents. 
Being a stay at home parent is inofitself a full time job, so naturally I took on more duties around the home and found ways to optimize for success. I created processes to achieve efficiency with household chores and to open better lines of communication between my spouse and I. For instance, my spouse and I have used kanban boards on our kitchen wall for home improvement projects, along with a backlog of chores needing to be done.
